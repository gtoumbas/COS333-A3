Contributions:

George: 

I wrote runserver.py in order to first created two get methods, one for the home page and the other for the details page. I added flask to the code to get the site running. I then designed the look of the website by writing the reg_search.html template and writing some of the reg_details.html template to display the details window. I debugged the code through boundary and statement testing. 


Shanzay: 

I edited runserver.py to take the results from the details query and convert the list into a dict. I then edited the reg_details.html template to include the hyperlink movements between pages, to properly save the information that is being input and fix the style of the page as a whole to match the reference. I then added the cookies to keep the search entries in their boxes. I debugged the code through boundary and statement testing.

Outside Help:
Just python online documentation.

Time Spent: ~10 hours

Assesment of Assignment:

I thoroughly enjoyed this assignment as it was a great stepping stone from the preivous assignment and the skills I learnt I also simultaneously used when designing the landing page for my COS333 project. By working with flask myself and understanding how to connect Python with HTML, I was able to better and more quickly code the page for my project. The only part that was a little bit difficult was getting the cookies working; however, that was a good challenge as it is something I plan to use for my project's website and hence it was useful to learn early on. A suggestion for improvement would be to explain how much of the design needs to match the example, for instance I was not sure if my details title being lower on the page than the example one would affect our grade.
